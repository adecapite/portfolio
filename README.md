-Included is my completed portfolio

Stylization: I wanted to toe the fine line of staying minimal but with bigger css effects.
An exmaple of such is my 'Work' section:

I added the effect of the shadow on hover so that the title of the work could be more legible.
I also decided to center the entire site to be easier to navigate.

With more experince I hope to be able to revist this again, but with closer to the idea I had originally for it.
